## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[CONTRIBUTING.md Code of Conduct](blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [README.md](./README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

I will be happy to take them.
